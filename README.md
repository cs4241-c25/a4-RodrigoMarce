## Priorities Task Manager

[My hosting link](https://a4-rodrigomarce.onrender.com)

I couldn't change the name of the Github repo or create a custom domain so it has my Github username (RodrigoMarce) instead of my first and last name. Also, my project is in a folder called rodrigo-marcenaro because react wouldn't let me create a new app with capital letters in the name.  

I modified the client side to be in React. I divided it by components (LoginButton, Task, TaskForm, TaskList) to have a better organization for the different elements in my app. I also created an api.js file to redirect all requests to the proper place. LoginButton had the "Log in through Github" button. Task had the client-side code for an individual task (name, due date, description and priority). TaskForm was the form for users to submit a task. Finally, TaskList was the list of all tasks sorted by priority.  

Besides the client side, I modified very little for Assignment 4. I had already implemented Github authentication for a3 and my app.js (server) stayed pretty much the same. However, I did deploy through Render. This was new to me but worked out well.
